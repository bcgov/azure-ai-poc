# Azure Proxy

A secure tunnel proxy for local development access to Azure PaaS using [Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel). This service creates a reverse proxy that allows developers to securely connect to Azure-hosted services from their local machines without exposing the database to public internet access.

## Overview

The Azure Proxy is built on Chisel, a fast TCP/UDP tunnel over HTTP. It provides:

- **Secure tunneling**: HTTPS-based communication with mandatory authentication
- **Local port forwarding**: Maps a local port to the remote Azure Services
- **Health checks**: Built-in health endpoint for monitoring and orchestration
- **Container-native**: Docker containerized for consistent deployment across environments
- **Automatic restart**: Includes retry logic for resilience

## Architecture

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running
- Access to the Azure Chisel server endpoint
- The Chisel authentication token

### Running Locally with Docker specifically for Postgres

Use the following command to establish a secure tunnel to the Azure Postgres:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5462:5432 jpillora/chisel:latest client \
  --auth "tunnel:XXXXXXX" \
  https://${azure-db-proxy-app-service-url} \
  0.0.0.0:5432:${postgres_hostname}$:5432
```
### Running Locally with Docker for socks proxy

Use the following command to establish a secure tunnel to the Azure Postgres:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 18080:1080 jpillora/chisel:latest client --auth "tunnel:XX" $prxoxy_url 0.0.0.0:1080:socks
```

#### Command Breakdown

- `--rm`: Automatically remove the container when it exits
- `-it`: Run in interactive mode with a TTY
- `-p 5462:5432`: Map local port `5462` to container port `5432` (PostgreSQL default)
- `jpillora/chisel:latest client`: Use Chisel in client mode to create an outbound tunnel
- `--auth "tunnel:XXXXXX"`: Authentication credentials for the Chisel server, replace with exact cred
- `https://${azure-db-proxy-app-service-url}`: The public URL of the Chisel server running in Azure, replace with actual URL
- `0.0.0.0:5432:${postgres_hostname}:5432`: Forward all interfaces on port 5432 to the remote PostgreSQL database on port 5432, replace actual host

#### Connecting to the Proxied Database

Once the Chisel tunnel is running, connect to PostgreSQL using after replacing with actual values:

```bash
psql -h localhost -p 5462 -U ${postgres_user} -d ${postgres_db}
```

Or in your application configuration, use:

```
Database Host: localhost
Port: 5462
Username: ${postgres_user}
Database: ${postgres_db}
```

## Azure Deployment

### Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

The Azure Proxy is deployed as an Azure App Service using Terraform. Key resources:

- **App Service Plan**: Linux-based hosting for the proxy container
- **Web App**: Runs the Chisel server container
- **Application Insights**: Monitoring and diagnostics
- **Virtual Network Integration**: Securely connects to your VNet


## Environment Variables

### Chisel Configuration

- **`CHISEL_AUTH`** (required): Authentication credentials in format `username:password`. Example: `tunnel:XXXXXX`
  - When set, clients must authenticate with these credentials
  - If not set, the server runs unauthenticated (not recommended for production)

- **`CHISEL_PORT`** (optional): Port the Chisel server listens on. Default: `80`
  - Must match the exposed port when running in containers

- **`CHISEL_HOST`** (optional): Host address to bind to. Default: `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces)

- **`CHISEL_ENABLE_SOCKS5`** (optional): Enable SOCKS5 proxy support. Default: `true`
  - Set to `false` if SOCKS5 is not needed

- **`CHISEL_EXTRA_ARGS`** (optional): Additional Chisel server arguments for advanced configuration

### Health Monitoring

- **`MAX_RETRIES`** (optional): Maximum retry attempts on failure. Default: `30`

- **`DELAY_SECONDS`** (optional): Delay between retries in seconds. Default: `5`

## Health Checks

### Health Endpoint

The proxy includes a built-in health check endpoint:

```
GET /healthz
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy"
}
```



## Startup Process

The `start-chisel.sh` script orchestrates the startup:

1. **Validates Chisel binary**: Ensures Chisel is available
2. **Starts health backend**: Launches a minimal HTTP server on port 9999 for health checks
3. **Starts Chisel server**: Launches the tunnel server with configured authentication
4. **Health check reverse proxy**: Chisel reverse-proxies `/healthz` requests to the health backend
5. **Retry logic**: Automatically restarts on failure (up to `MAX_RETRIES` times)
6. **Graceful shutdown**: Responds to termination signals and cleans up processes

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- Always set `CHISEL_AUTH` with a strong password in production
- Use format: `username:password` (e.g., `tunnel:YourSecurePasswordHere`)
- Store the password securely

### Network Security

- The proxy should only be accessible from trusted networks
- Restrict inbound access using ip restriction on app service
- Use HTTPS for all client connections to the proxy

### Database Access

- The proxy does not store or log database credentials
- PostgreSQL credentials are handled separately on the client side
- Always use encrypted connections (SSL/TLS) when available

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Refused

**Problem**: `Connection refused` when connecting to `localhost:5462`

**Solution**: 
- Verify the Chisel tunnel is running: `docker ps`
- Check the port mapping: `-p 5462:5432` must be in the docker command
- Ensure the Azure proxy endpoint is reachable

### Authentication Failed

**Problem**: `Authorization failed` or `Auth failed` in logs

**Solution**:
- Verify the `--auth` parameter matches the server's `CHISEL_AUTH` setting
- Ensure the password is correct and not expired
- Check Azure Key Vault for the current credentials

### Cannot Resolve Hostname

**Problem**: `Cannot resolve hostname 'xxxxx.database.azure.com'`

**Solution**:
- Verify the Azure proxy server has network access to the PostgreSQL database
- Check Network Security Group (NSG) rules allow outbound traffic on port 5432
- Ensure the PostgreSQL server name is correct

### High Latency

**Problem**: Slow database connections through the proxy

**Solution**:
- The Chisel server adds minimal overhead; check the Azure App Service plan tier
- Upgrade to a higher SKU (B2, B3, S1) if running on B1
- Check network latency between regions

## Accessing Azure Portal or services from local
### Using firefox with a proxy extension to login to azure portal to access PaaS Services.
- Add SmartProxy extension for firefox and add these details for proxy server (local)
        server = localhost port =18080 or the port you used to run chisel client for socks, 
- check the checkbox Proxy DNS when using socks5
- proxy portocol is SOCKS5
- now you should be able to access cosmosdb or other services running in your vnet and environment.
