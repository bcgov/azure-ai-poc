# Feature Specification: Add Microsoft Agent Lightning Integration

**Feature Branch**: `chore/try`  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add Microsoft Agent Ligtning to the existing application"

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Agent Lightning Framework Integration (Priority: P1)

Add Microsoft Agent Lightning as an agent optimization layer on top of the existing LangChain/LangGraph architecture. Agent Lightning will optimize agent performance through reinforcement learning, automatic prompt optimization, and supervised fine-tuning—without requiring code changes to existing agents.

**Why this priority**: Agent Lightning enables production-grade optimization of existing agents (zero code change required). It works with ANY agent framework (LangChain, OpenAI Agent SDK, AutoGen, CrewAI, or custom). This unlocks continuous improvement capabilities for our document QA and multi-agent workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by deploying Agent Lightning optimization framework alongside existing LangGraph agents and verifying performance improvement on test queries.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Agent Lightning is configured and LangGraph agents are registered, **When** I execute a query, **Then** Agent Lightning captures the agent's behavior without code changes
2. **Given** Agent Lightning has collected baseline metrics, **When** I enable prompt optimization, **Then** the agent's performance improves (better answer quality, fewer tokens, faster execution)
3. **Given** multiple agents are registered, **When** I selectively optimize one agent via Agent Lightning, **Then** that agent improves without affecting others

---

### User Story 2 - Optimize Document QA Workflow with Agent Lightning (Priority: P1)

Integrate Agent Lightning's optimization capabilities into the existing document QA workflow to improve answer quality, reduce token usage, and increase execution speed—without modifying the LangChain/LangGraph implementation.

**Why this priority**: This is the critical path for production adoption. Agent Lightning's optimization algorithms (RL, prompt optimization, SFT) directly improve the core business capability (document QA quality and cost).

**Independent Test**: Document QA endpoint should continue to work identically, but Agent Lightning runs optimization in the background to incrementally improve quality metrics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the document QA agent is wrapped with Agent Lightning, **When** queries are executed, **Then** Agent Lightning collects execution metrics without breaking existing API
2. **Given** Agent Lightning has collected sufficient data, **When** automatic prompt optimization is triggered, **Then** the next queries show improved metrics (higher confidence, better answer quality)
3. **Given** a baseline metric is established, **When** optimization completes, **Then** the system demonstrates measurable improvement (e.g., 10%+ confidence increase)

---

### User Story 3 - Multi-Agent Optimization with Agent Lightning (Priority: P2)

Use Agent Lightning's selective optimization to improve specific agents in the multi-agent workflows (query planner, document analyzer, answer generator) independently, tuning each for its specific role.

**Why this priority**: Advanced capability that improves answer quality through specialized agent tuning. Can be added after P1 is stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by enabling selective optimization on one agent in the multi-agent workflow and verifying improvements without affecting other agents.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple agents are running in production, **When** I select the query planner agent for optimization, **Then** Agent Lightning optimizes only that agent
2. **Given** the query planner is optimized, **When** I run multi-agent workflows, **Then** planning quality improves without breaking coordination between agents
3. **Given** each agent is optimized independently, **When** I examine metrics, **Then** the overall workflow quality improves (faster planning + better document selection = better answers)

---

### User Story 4 - Agent Lightning Observability & Optimization Analytics (Priority: P2)

Implement OpenTelemetry instrumentation for Agent Lightning optimization workflows to provide visibility into optimization decisions, agent performance improvements, and cost impacts.

**Why this priority**: Required for production deployment. Enables debugging and ROI analysis of optimization efforts.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running Agent Lightning optimization and verifying optimization metrics and ROI analysis appear in monitoring system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Agent Lightning is running optimizations, **When** I query the tracing system, **Then** I see optimization decisions (which algorithm was chosen, why)
2. **Given** an agent has been optimized, **When** I examine metrics, **Then** I can see before/after comparison (quality improvement %, token reduction, latency change)
3. **Given** multiple optimizations have run, **When** I examine cost metrics, **Then** I can quantify ROI (token savings × cost per token)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Agent Lightning is unavailable? (Fallback to Azure OpenAI direct call)
- How does the system handle timeouts in multi-agent workflows? (Graceful timeout with structured error)
- What if an agent returns unparseable output? (Error handling + retry logic)
- How are token limits handled across multi-agent conversations? (Automatic context trimming)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST integrate Microsoft Agent Lightning as an optimization layer on top of existing LangChain/LangGraph agents
- **FR-002**: Agent Lightning MUST work with existing agents WITHOUT requiring code changes (zero-code-change requirement)
- **FR-003**: Agent Lightning MUST support optimization algorithms: Reinforcement Learning, Automatic Prompt Optimization, Supervised Fine-Tuning
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve all existing API contracts; Agent Lightning is internal optimization layer only
- **FR-005**: Agent Lightning MUST support selective optimization (choose which agent(s) to optimize independently)
- **FR-006**: System MUST collect agent execution metrics (latency, token usage, output quality) to train optimization models
